"""One log line per HTTP request — the record that a request happened at all.

Deliberately metadata-only: no request/response bodies. Reading the body here
would consume Starlette's single-shot request stream and risks breaking every
downstream route. Payload logging happens at the router layer instead (see
app.core.logging.log_payload), where the *validated* Pydantic model is already
in hand, is trivially redactable, and costs nothing extra to serialize.

request_id comes from the formatter (ContextVar). actor_user_id/actor_org_id
can't: they're bound in the route's dependency, which runs in a child task
whose context never propagates back up here — so they're read off
request.state instead. See app.core.request_context.bind_actor().
