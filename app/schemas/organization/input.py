# ── Sub-resource schemas ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Organization is a set-once-rarely-edited resource — unlike Patient/
# Practitioner there are no standalone sub-resource endpoints, so each
# sub-resource has a single input shape (no separate Patch variant): every
# supplied list on OrganizationCreateSchema/OrganizationPatchSchema (even
# `[]`) replaces the corresponding rows wholesale.
#
# Field descriptions below quote or closely paraphrase the official FHIR R4
# spec (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/organization.html and
# https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) for the corresponding element —
# `identifier` mirrors the Identifier datatype, `telecom` mirrors
# ContactPoint, `address` mirrors Address, `type`/`purpose` mirror
# CodeableConcept/Coding. Fallback `*_identifier_*` blocks (this codebase's
# own convention, not a distinct FHIR element) reuse the same Identifier
# field definitions since they represent Reference.identifier — the logical
# identifier FHIR itself defines as the fallback when a Reference can't
# point at an actual resource.
